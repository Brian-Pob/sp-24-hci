## Introduction of the Project - GroupConnect

Our project allows user to find and create events they are interested in. Users can find events via three different methods, basic search, tags, and filters. Additionally, users can register for events and later view them in their saved events tab. Users who create events could add a title, date, time, location, tags, and description to their event post.

## Summary of User Research

In short, our research led us to find that people found the search aspect of our project very intuitive and easy to use. Users described how they instantly understood how things worked when the concept of the project was described to them. Moreover, we found that people were really interested in using our project to find events that suited their interests. Additionally, we found that our app was really useful to freshman and newly transferred students to FSU as it allowed them to find new friends that were already interested in the same activities as themselves.
